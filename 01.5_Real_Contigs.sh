# STEP 01.5 - strip the raw basefeatures GTF down to real gene records on
# real contigs only, with Mt contig naming fixed BEFORE filtering so the
# mitochondrial genes survive. Independent of the GMAP steps.

# 0. fix Mt contig naming BEFORE any filtering - the raw GTF uses plain "Mt"
#    but the genome FASTA uses "Mt_CtarK1_noOVERLAP_RC.1". If this isn't done
#    first, the contig filter below silently drops all 6 mitochondrial genes
#    since "Mt" never matches anything in real_contigs.txt.
